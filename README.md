# CSC4160 — Cloud Computing (Assignments)

This repository contains my coursework for **CSC4160 Cloud Computing**,

## Repo structure

- `assignment-1/` — Foundations & environment setup
- `assignment-2/` — Cloud services / deployment workflow
- `assignment-3/` — Serverless vs VM benchmarking (e.g., AWS Lambda vs EC2 style experiments)
- `assignment-4/` — Distributed data processing (e.g., multi-node cluster + Hadoop/Spark style pipeline)

---

## Assignment 1 — Foundations & setup

**Goal:** get comfortable with cloud basics and tooling.

- environment setup (CLI / SDK / credentials)
- compute instance basics, storage, networking/security groups
- small sanity-check scripts and screenshots/results

---

## Assignment 2 — Cloud services / deployment workflow

**Goal:** build something deployable and understand how cloud components fit together.

- containerization or packaging
- deployment steps + configuration
- simple service endpoint / automation + short write-up

---

## Assignment 3 — Benchmarking: serverless vs VM

**Goal:** measure performance/overhead trade-offs between execution models.

- benchmark runner scripts (compute-bound vs I/O-bound)
- latency distribution (cold start vs warm start), throughput, cost notes
- logs/results + short analysis

---

## Assignment 4 — Distributed processing (Hadoop/Spark style)

**Goal:** set up and run a distributed job on a small cluster.

- multi-node setup instructions
- HDFS + Spark/MapReduce jobs
- outputs and performance observations
